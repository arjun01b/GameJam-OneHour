I look over what father had written for {char4}. It read:
"To my daughter {char4}, I leave this sealed letter, so she may remember my words when I am no longer there."

{char0}: Alright so here it says...
What should I give her?
    *   {isLetterAvailible}[Give the sealed letter]
        {char0}: To my daughter {char4}, I leave this sealed letter, so she may remember my words when I am no longer there.
        I pull the letter from my suitcase and hand it over to her.

            I pull the dagger from my suitcase and hand it over to her.

            I pull the clock from my bag and hand it over to her.
            She seems happy and content.
            
            {char4}: Thank you brother.
            
            She leaves with a big smile on her face and the clock's hanging its chain.

{char2}: WHAT?! Why did he not leave me mum's ring?! It was the only thing I asked of him!

= char4_hideUnderDesk
I hear a faint knock before {char4} lets herself into the room.
She walks towards the desk, her heels clacking over the floor as she stands beside it, too close for comfort.
She hasn't noticed me yet, I might be able to get awayâ€”
A thin hand reaches from the side, tugging on one of the drawers.
I yelp in surprise as the drawer opens with a jarring sound.
{char4} freezes.
{char4}: Benjamin?
~ hasBeenFoundUnderDeskBefore = true
+[I've already given myself away.]
    I stand up, brushing the dust off myself.
    {char0}: Hello Lilly.
    {char4}: And to you.
    She looks me over, seeming like she was assessing me.
    {char4}: You look... well enough.

+[She probably didn't notice me.]
    A quick patter of her heels, she whips away the chair, revealing my awkwardly hunched form under the desk.
    {char4}: What are you doing?
    ++["Tying my shoelaces."]
        {char0}: I was tying my shoelaces and I got stuck under there.
        {char0}: Thanks for helping me out.
        {char4}: I... see.
        She looks me over, seeming like she was assessing me.
        {char4}: You look... well enough.
        {char0}: I'm jolly good, thanks for noticing, how about yourself?
        {char4}: (Unamused) I'm doing great, thanks for asking I suppose.
        
    ++["Looking for my lucky penny."]
        {char0}: Sorry, I was just looking for my lucky penny.
        {char4}: Oh dear! Did you find it?
        {char0}: Yes, safely in my wallet now.
        {char4}: Why that's a relief.
        She looks me over, seeming like she was assessing me.
        {char4}: Looks like you need it.
